<h1 class="adsimple-313077643">Privacy Policy</h1>
<h2 id="einleitung-ueberblick" class="adsimple-313077643">Introduction and Overview</h2>
<p>We have written this privacy policy (version 11.11.2025-313077643) to explain to you, in accordance with the
    requirements of the <a class="adsimple-313077643"
        href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/DE/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32016R0679&amp;from=DE&amp;tid=313077643#d1e2269-1-1"
        target="_blank" rel="noopener">General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679</a> and applicable national
    laws, which personal data (in short, “data”) we, as the data controller, and our commissioned processors (e.g.,
    providers), process, will process in the future, and what lawful options you have. All terms used are to be
    understood as gender-neutral.<br /> <strong class="adsimple-313077643">In short:</strong> We inform you
    comprehensively about the data we process about you.</p>
<p>Privacy policies usually sound very technical and use legal terminology. However, this privacy policy aims to
    describe the most important points as simply and transparently as possible. Where it benefits transparency,
    technical <strong class="adsimple-313077643">terms are explained in a user-friendly way</strong>, links to
    additional information are provided, and <strong class="adsimple-313077643">graphics</strong> are used. We aim to
    communicate in clear and simple language that we only process personal data within our business activities when
    there is a corresponding legal basis. That would not be possible if we offered vague or overly technical
    explanations, as is often standard on the Internet when it comes to data protection. We hope you find the following
    explanations interesting and informative — and maybe there’s something new for you to learn.<br /> If you still have
    questions, please contact the responsible body listed below or in the imprint, follow the provided links, and review
    additional information on third-party websites. You will, of course, also find our contact details in the imprint.
</p>
<h2 id="anwendungsbereich" class="adsimple-313077643">Scope of Application</h2>
<p>This privacy policy applies to all personal data processed by us within our company and to all personal data
    processed by companies commissioned by us (processors). By personal data, we mean information as defined in Art. 4
    No. 1 GDPR, such as a person’s name, email address, or postal address. The processing of personal data ensures that
    we can offer and invoice our services and products, whether online or offline. The scope of this privacy policy
    includes:</p>
<ul class="adsimple-313077643">
    <li class="adsimple-313077643">all online presences (websites, online shops) operated by us</li>
    <li class="adsimple-313077643">social media presences and email communication</li>
    <li class="adsimple-313077643">mobile apps for smartphones and other devices</li>
</ul>
<p><strong class="adsimple-313077643">In short:</strong> This privacy policy applies to all areas in which personal data
    in our company are processed in a structured manner through the channels mentioned. If we enter into legal
    relationships with you outside these channels, we will inform you separately if necessary.</p>
<h2 id="rechtsgrundlagen" class="adsimple-313077643">Legal Bases</h2>
<p>In the following privacy policy, we provide transparent information about the legal principles and regulations — that
    is, the legal bases of the General Data Protection Regulation — that allow us to process personal data.<br />
    Regarding EU law, we refer to REGULATION (EU) 2016/679 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 27 April
    2016. You can, of course, read this EU General Data Protection Regulation online on EUR-Lex, the access portal to EU
    law, at <a class="adsimple-313077643"
        href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/DE/ALL/?uri=celex%3A32016R0679">https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/DE/ALL/?uri=celex%3A32016R0679</a>.
</p>
<p>We only process your data if at least one of the following conditions applies:</p>
<ol>
    <li class="adsimple-313077643"><strong class="adsimple-313077643">Consent</strong> (Article 6(1)(a) GDPR): You have
        given us your consent to process data for a specific purpose. An example would be the storage of information you
        enter in a contact form.</li>
    <li class="adsimple-313077643"><strong class="adsimple-313077643">Contract</strong> (Article 6(1)(b) GDPR): To
        fulfill a contract or pre-contractual obligations with you, we process your data. For example, if we conclude a
        purchase agreement with you, we require personal information beforehand.</li>
    <li class="adsimple-313077643"><strong class="adsimple-313077643">Legal Obligation</strong> (Article 6(1)(c) GDPR):
        If we are subject to a legal obligation, we process your data. For example, we are legally required to retain
        invoices for accounting purposes, which usually contain personal data.</li>
    <li class="adsimple-313077643"><strong class="adsimple-313077643">Legitimate Interests</strong> (Article 6(1)(f)
        GDPR): In cases of legitimate interests that do not override your fundamental rights, we reserve the right to
        process personal data. For instance, we must process certain data to operate our website safely and economically
        efficiently. This processing thus constitutes a legitimate interest.</li>
</ol>
<p>Other bases such as the performance of tasks carried out in the public interest, the exercise of official authority,
    or the protection of vital interests generally do not apply to us. Should such a legal basis become relevant, it
    will be indicated at the appropriate place.</p>
<p>In addition to the EU regulation, national laws also apply:</p>
<ul class="adsimple-313077643">
    <li class="adsimple-313077643">In <strong class="adsimple-313077643">Austria</strong>, this is the Federal Act on
        the Protection of Natural Persons with regard to the Processing of Personal Data (<strong
            class="adsimple-313077643">Data Protection Act</strong>), abbreviated as <strong
            class="adsimple-313077643">DSG</strong>.</li>
    <li class="adsimple-313077643">In <strong class="adsimple-313077643">Germany</strong>, this is the <strong
            class="adsimple-313077643">Federal Data Protection Act</strong>, abbreviated as <strong
            class="adsimple-313077643">BDSG</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>If other regional or national laws apply, we will inform you in the respective sections below.</p>

<h2 id="speicherdauer" class="adsimple-313077643">Storage Duration</h2>
<p>As a general rule, we only store personal data for as long as it is absolutely necessary to provide our services and
    products. This means that we delete personal data as soon as the reason for processing it no longer exists. In some
    cases, we are legally required to retain certain data even after the original purpose no longer applies — for
    example, for accounting purposes.</p>
<p>If you request the deletion of your data or withdraw your consent to data processing, the data will be deleted as
    quickly as possible unless there is a legal obligation to retain it.</p>
<p>We will inform you further below about the specific duration of each data processing activity if we have additional
    information on that.</p>
<h2 id="rechte-dsgvo" class="adsimple-313077643">Rights under the General Data Protection Regulation</h2>
<p>In accordance with Articles 13 and 14 of the GDPR, we inform you of the following rights to ensure fair and
    transparent data processing:</p>
<ul class="adsimple-313077643">
    <li class="adsimple-313077643">Under Article 15 GDPR, you have the right to know whether we process data about you.
        If that is the case, you have the right to receive a copy of the data and obtain the following information: <ul
            class="adsimple-313077643">
            <li class="adsimple-313077643">the purpose for which we carry out the processing;</li>

        </ul>
    </li>
    <li class="adsimple-313077643">Under Article 16 GDPR, you have the right to rectification of data, which means we
        must correct data if you find errors.</li>
    <li class="adsimple-313077643">Under Article 17 GDPR, you have the right to erasure (“right to be forgotten”), which
        specifically means you can request the deletion of your data.</li>
    <li class="adsimple-313077643">Under Article 18 GDPR, you have the right to restriction of processing, which means
        that we may only store the data but not use it further.</li>
    <li class="adsimple-313077643">Under Article 20 GDPR, you have the right to data portability, which means that we
        must provide your data to you upon request in a commonly used format.</li>
    <li class="adsimple-313077643">Under Article 21 GDPR, you have the right to object, which, once exercised, will
        result in a change to the processing. <ul class="adsimple-313077643">
            <li class="adsimple-313077643">If the processing of your data is based on Article 6(1)(e) (public interest,
                exercise of official authority) or Article 6(1)(f) (legitimate interest), you may object to the
                processing. We will then promptly examine whether we can legally comply with this objection.</li>
            <li class="adsimple-313077643">If data are used for direct marketing, you can object to this type of data
                processing at any time. We may then no longer use your data for direct marketing.</li>
            <li class="adsimple-313077643">If data are used for profiling, you can also object to this type of
                processing at any time. We may then no longer use your data for profiling.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li class="adsimple-313077643">Under Article 22 GDPR, you may, in some circumstances, have the right not to be
        subject to a decision based solely on automated processing (such as profiling).</li>
    <li class="adsimple-313077643">Under Article 77 GDPR, you have the right to lodge a complaint. This means you can
        contact the data protection authority at any time if you believe that the processing of your personal data
        violates the GDPR.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong class="adsimple-313077643">In short:</strong> You have rights — don’t hesitate to contact the responsible
    office listed above!</p>
<p>If you believe that the processing of your data violates data protection law or that your data protection rights have
    been otherwise infringed, you can lodge a complaint with the supervisory authority. In Austria, this is the Data
    Protection Authority, whose website you can find at <a class="adsimple-313077643"
        href="https://www.dsb.gv.at/?tid=313077643" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.dsb.gv.at/</a>. In
    Germany, each federal state has its own data protection commissioner. For more information, you can contact the <a

    the following local data protection authority is responsible:</p>

<h2 id="sicherheit-datenverarbeitung" class="adsimple-313077643">Security of Data Processing</h2>
<p>To protect personal data, we have implemented both technical and organizational measures. Wherever possible, we
    encrypt or pseudonymize personal data. This makes it as difficult as possible for third parties to infer personal
    information from our data within the limits of our capabilities.</p>
<p>Article 25 GDPR refers to “data protection by design and by default,” meaning that both in software (e.g., forms) and
    hardware (e.g., access to the server room), security is always considered and appropriate measures are implemented.
    In the following sections, we will describe specific measures where applicable.</p>
<h2 id="tls-verschluesselung-https" class="adsimple-313077643">TLS Encryption with HTTPS</h2>
<p>TLS, encryption, and HTTPS sound very technical — and they are. We use HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) to
    securely transmit data over the Internet.<br /> This means that the entire transfer of data from your browser to our
    web server is encrypted — no one can “listen in.”</p>
<p>This adds an extra layer of security and ensures compliance with data protection by design (<a
        class="adsimple-313077643"
        href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/DE/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32016R0679&amp;from=DE&amp;tid=313077643"
        target="_blank" rel="noopener">Article 25(1) GDPR</a>). By using TLS (Transport Layer Security), an encryption
    protocol for secure data transmission on the Internet, we can guarantee the protection of confidential data.<br />
    You can recognize the use of this secure transmission by the small padlock icon <img role="img"
        src="https://www.adsimple.at/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/schlosssymbol-https.svg" width="17" height="18" /> in
    your browser, usually shown to the left of the web address (e.g., examplepage.de), and by the use of “https”
    (instead of “http”) as part of our Internet address.<br /> If you want to learn more about encryption, we recommend
    searching for “Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure wiki” on Google for good links to further information.</p>

<h3 class="adsimple-313077643">What Are Push Notifications?</h3>
<p>We also use so-called push notification services on our website to keep our users up to date. This means that, if you
    have consented to receive such push notifications, we can send you short news messages using a software tool. Push
    notifications are a form of text message that appear directly on your smartphone or other devices such as tablets or
    PCs, once you’ve subscribed to them. You can receive these messages even if you are not currently visiting our
    website or actively using our service. During this process, data such as your location and usage behavior may also
    be collected and stored.</p>
<h3 class="adsimple-313077643">Why Do We Use Push Notifications?</h3>
<p>On one hand, we use push notifications to fully deliver the services we have contractually agreed upon with you. On
    the other hand, these notifications also serve our online marketing purposes. They allow us to promote our services
    or products and inform you immediately when there are updates or news about our company. We aim to understand the
    preferences and habits of all our users as best as possible to continuously improve our offerings.</p>
<h3 class="adsimple-313077643">What Data Are Processed?</h3>
<p>To receive push notifications, you must confirm that you want to receive them. The data collected during this consent
    process are stored, managed, and processed. This is necessary to prove and recognize that a user has agreed to
    receive push notifications. For this purpose, a so-called device token or push token is stored in your browser.
    Usually, the data about your location or the location of your device are also stored.</p>
<p>To ensure we always send interesting and important push notifications, interactions with the messages are
    statistically evaluated. For example, we can see whether and when you open a message. Using these insights, we can
    adapt our communication strategy to your preferences and interests. Although these stored data could theoretically
    be linked to you personally, we do not aim to analyze you as an individual. Instead, we are interested in aggregated
    user data to improve our service. You can find details about which data are stored in the respective providers’
    privacy policies.</p>
<h3 class="adsimple-313077643">Duration of Data Processing</h3>
<p>The duration of data processing and storage primarily depends on the tool we use. You can find more information about
    data processing for each tool further below. The providers’ privacy policies usually specify exactly which data are
    stored and for how long. Generally, personal data are processed only as long as necessary to provide our services.
    If data are stored in cookies, storage duration can vary widely — some are deleted immediately after leaving a
    website, while others may be stored for several years. You should therefore review each cookie individually if you
    wish to know more about specific storage durations. The providers’ privacy policies usually contain detailed
    information about each cookie.</p>
<h3 class="adsimple-313077643">Legal Basis</h3>
<p>In some cases, push notifications may be necessary to fulfill certain contractual obligations — for example, to
    inform you about technical or organizational updates. In this case, the legal basis is Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR.</p>
<p>If that is not the case, push notifications are sent only with your consent. Our push notifications may include
    promotional content and may also be sent depending on your device’s location. The analytical evaluations mentioned
    above are also based on your consent to receive such notifications. The legal basis, in this case, is Art. 6(1)(a)
    GDPR. You can withdraw your consent or change your settings at any time.</p>
